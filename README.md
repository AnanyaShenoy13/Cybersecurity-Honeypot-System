## 🔐 Features

- ✅ Real-time detection of common cyberattacks (SQL Injection, XSS, Brute Force, etc.)
- 📍 IP geolocation tracking and heatmap visualization
- 📊 Interactive dashboard with Plotly charts and analytics
- 🌐 WebSocket-based real-time data streaming
- 🗂️ Attack classification and logging
- 📁 Clean folder structure and modular codebase

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python (Flask), WebSockets  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Plotly.js  
- **Database:** SQLite (or PostgreSQL)  
- **Others:** Geolocation APIs (e.g., ipinfo.io), Dash/Chart libraries
